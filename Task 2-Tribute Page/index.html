        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15
        October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and
        statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007.
        He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and
        aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
        science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
        Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
        was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military
        missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile
        Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and
        launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal
        organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II
        nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by
        India in 1974.[5] Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in
        2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
        then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
        "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education,
        writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of
        several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
        civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of
        Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac
        arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level
        dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of
        Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.[8]
